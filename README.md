# Resolith &mdash; "omg that's overhead" display web inspector

When you google *"my screen resolution"* via your smartphone all results from 1st page will report you false resolution. Damn, even guys with awesome domain names like [whatismyscreenresolution.com](https://wwww.whatismyscreenresolution.com) & [whatismyscreenresolution.net](http://whatismyscreenresolution.net)! Not optimized for mobile phones, filled with annoying ads and useless information &mdash; that's the web today. It's time to show people how should frontend look like.

## Resolith is...

* Progressive Web Application
* UX flavored minimalistic design
* fast as Speedy Gonzales
* and light as Senjougahara

As you may intend, it was build just for fun &mdash; not for professional purposes. But it still may be useful for some folks who don't know their device's screen resolution. Ask any iPhone owner it's native screen resolution and he will ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This app is so simple that it does not even need tests.
