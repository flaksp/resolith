When you google *"my screen resolution"* via your smartphone, all websites from the 1st page will mislead you. Damn, even guys with awesome domain names like [whatismyscreenresolution.com](https://www.whatismyscreenresolution.com) & [whatismyscreenresolution.net](http://whatismyscreenresolution.net)! Not optimized for mobile phones, filled with annoying ads and useless information &mdash; that's the web today. It's time to show people how frontend should look like.

Resolith is...

* Progressive Web Application;
* UX flavored minimalistic design;
* fast like Speedy Gonzales;
* light like Senjougahara.

As you may assume, it was built just for fun &mdash; not for professional purposes. But it still may be useful for some folks who don't know their device's screen resolution. Ask any iPhone user its native screen resolution and they will ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This app is so simple that it does not even need tests!
